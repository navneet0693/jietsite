						 	<span> <br /><p>With the stupendous growth of technical education in the country a need was felt for a body to ensure quality of the institutions imparting engineering education. The All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE) being the apex organization set up the <strong>National Board of Accreditation (NBA) </strong>for periodic evaluation of Under Graduate and Post Graduate programmes running in an institution. The Board functions as per the specified norms and standards as recommended by AICTE.

							<br /><br />The NBA is equally concerned with assessing and assuring the quality of various constituent elements of the technical institutions, such as academic ambience, infrastructure, financial resources, physical resources, human resources, supporting systems like library resources, computational resources and avenues to mould and develop the students’ personality and learning capacities.

							<br /><br />The NBA inspection team visited the college from 24- 26 March, 2011. The NBA expert team included the following members who through critical analysis recommended the college for accreditation to NBA in the <strong> Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Computer Engineering and Electronics & Communication Engineering</strong> vied their file No. F.32-1/2010-NBA on 20th September, 2011.</p></span>
