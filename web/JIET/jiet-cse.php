		    			   <span> <strong class="backglow"> </strong> <br /> <p> The field of electronics and communication is advancing at a very rapid pace. Mobile telephony and Personal Communication System have grown exponentially over the last one and half decade. With the penetration of Laptop and wearable devices, the access to the Internet and World Wide Web for obtaining vides variety of new data services; are going to be the driving forces for further development of new types of network and new technologies. In the coming years, we will be dealing with intelligent networks, smart electronic devices and advanced access techniques. Therefore more and more emphasis on deeper understanding of fundamentals of electronics and communication, digital, processing, knowledge of state of art fabrication of RF Devices, computing, new protocols and access techniques are essential both for teacher and students. The department of Electronics has grown up tremendously over the last few years. The ECE Deptt is running B Tech and M Tech courses. New laboratories are being added up every year to improve our capacity and capabilities to carry out new projects and experiments.
</p></span><br>
		    			   <span><strong class="backglow"> </strong> <br /> <p>  Applied Research is our prime focus. Development and growth of faculty is given special attention. Faculty is encouraged and sponsored for higher studies and sent for participation in seminar. Faculty is also engaged in organizing AICTE sponsored Staff Development Programme at JIET UNIVERSE. The turnover of Faculty is minimal and majority of them are with masters degrees. The training and project work by the students are the major thrust areas. Concerted effort is made to find out the suitable industry for the purpose of training. Students are encouraged to take up project with greater applications in the field. The focus has been to synergize the project work and the industrial training. The students are taken on industrial visits to various industries. The department has fully equipped laboratories with the state of the art equipment.
